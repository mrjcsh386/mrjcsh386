I'm planning on generating an ascii map of my network so I can continue to 
comply with my intent for users to be able to use my repos in server installs 
of Linux.

In addition to this, I'm going to update 'Documents' with usage for git. I 
also would like to include ansible, and azure-cli. Nothing fancy for the moment 
just wanting to get started.

On a personal note, I will be architecting a schedule for the installation of 
braincastle. Steps to be made and at what point security measures should be 
baked into the process if someone is following along.
